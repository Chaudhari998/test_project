# TypeScript Testing Project - `test_project`

## Overview
Welcome to the `test_project` repository! This project is part of my coursework in Computer Science, where I am focusing on testing and evaluating the TypeScript language, developed by Microsoft. The primary goal is to ensure robustness, reliability, and efficiency in TypeScript's compiler and language services.

## Objectives
- **Testing TypeScript Compiler**: Ensuring that new features and bug fixes in the TypeScript compiler do not introduce regressions.
- **Improving Language Services**: Enhancing the performance and accuracy of TypeScript's language services.
- **Documentation**: Providing clear documentation and suggestions for future testing and development.

## Tools and Frameworks Used
- **Node.js**: For running TypeScript and tests.
- **Jest/Mocha**: Testing frameworks used for unit tests.
- **TypeScript**: The primary language for writing tests.

## Installation and Setup
